# My Machine Learning Journey

## What is it?
This repository consists of the materials used and developed during my studies on machine learning.

### Who am I
My name is Clarissa Lima, I am a graduate student in Information Systems at UFMG and a graduate student in Control and Automation Engineering at PUC-Minas. Look at my profile later to know more about me :)

<!--You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Clalloures/Machine-Learning/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.
  Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
  ### Markdown
    Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for
```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
- Bulleted
- List
1. Numbered
2. List
**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text
[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```
For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
### Jekyll Themes
Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Clalloures/Machine-Learning/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
